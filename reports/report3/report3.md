## Option 1: -n

The first ```grep``` option we will explore will be the ```-n``` option, which adds the line number where the matching line can be found within its input file to the front of each output line. This can be very useful if we are interested in locating the lines outputted and taking some sort of action upon them.

Let's take a look at an example:

```
$ grep -rn "hello"
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToHongKong.txt:484:        the local people smile “hello” and, if you’re lucky, point you to a
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToItaly.txt:2041:        (or Ca’ Grande), while gondoliers claim Othello’s Desdemona lived in
```

As we can see in this example, the matching lines that contain "hello" are printed as usual, but on the left, we can see the file and the line number where the line is located. If I wanted to go back and change them to "goodbye" instead, it would be much easier.

Here's another example:

```
$ grep -rn "flag"
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch3.txt:5:In 1911, John Wanamaker opened his flagship store in downtown Philadelphia. The twelve-story building, with its forty-five acres of floor space, was the largest of its time devoted to retail merchandising. Its central “Grand Court” had marble arches that rose 150 feet and was capped by a dome. Major physical innovations were hidden behind this visual wonder: sixty-eight state-of-the-art elevators; the latest in fireproofing; a large power plant devoted entirely to the store; and sophisticated heating, ventilating, and sanitation systems.
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch3.txt:59:With these systems in place, it began to develop distribution centers capable of being efficient intermediaries between its suppliers and stores. Finally, like the mass merchants and national chains, Dillard’s started insisting that its suppliers invest in corresponding technologies to allow electronic reordering and to meet its increasingly stringent service requirements. But unlike a mass merchant that typically manages over 125,000 separate items in a large store, the Dillard’s system uses this information to manage over one million SKUs in one of its flagship stores.36
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch3.txt:60:Federated originated as a decentralized “federation” of well-known stores like Rich’s and Bloomingdale’s, with wide variation in both its merchandising and back-room activities. Like Dillard’s, its stores carry a vast array of products: a typical department store may have 800,000 items; its flagship Macy’s in midtown Manhattan offers more than two million separate SKUs. During the 1980s, however, the amount of inventory held by Federated ballooned while it faced bankruptcy.
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch9.txt:36:The flow of operations through a typical men’s dress-shirt sewing factory is shown in Figure 9.1 (page 160). The subassemblies for the collars, backs, fronts, cuffs, and sleeves might be on one side of a center aisle down the factory floor and the major assembly steps on the other side. The factory manager needs to keep track of the flow of items through the plant to assure that the subassemblies, such as the sleeves, are ready to join the shirt. A given shirt must have a specified collar size and a given sleeve length. Clearly, the fabric, color, and style must also match. If the cut bundles are sent to the factory once a week, this manager might then put that week’s bundles into carts identified by a flag flying the color for that week. Note that the work in a shirt plant is generally grouped into production lots of 1,500 shirts if the progressive bundle system is used. Shirts are normally counted by the dozen, so a production lot comes to 125 dozen.
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch9.txt:37:Each day, the manager looks over the factory floor to see if any carts with a particular flag color are falling behind the others of that group. Delays in product flow can result from machine problems, worker absence, or if priority is given to special orders. In some plants, the carts may contain up to a day’s worth of work. Although this may appear to be a crude way of keeping track of the work flow, it is simple and generally effective. Still, work almost never progresses in perfect lockstep through a factory. Finding the correct parts for a shirt can often involve a hunt through the plant. For example, a worker might accidentally leave a bundle of unfinished work in the cart when it goes back to be loaded again. Because a worker may have a day’s work in the carts in front of her, it is easy to see how individual bundles of parts can be misplaced—which, in turn, will hold up the assembly of some SKUs. Partially finished shirts and shirt subassemblies will then be in a number of places in the factory.
non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chP.txt:26:The craft and final product of cutting out intricate designs and patterns on sheets of tissue paper. In Mexico the artists who do this work have been doing it for several generations and can cut through fifty or more sheets at a time. A pattern is made and used as the top sheet while the outline design is cut out with different-sized chisels. Most often the small banner-sized sheets are made to decorate altars and nacimientos (nativity scenes), or for such celebrations as Cinco de Mayo (the Fifth of May) and El Diez y Seis de Septiembre (the Sixteenth of September). Mexican restaurants are often decorated with streams of colorful papel picado. Some of the cutout designs are scenes related to specific holidays, such as skeletons for Día de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead), dancers, floral patterns, the Mexican flag, and other patriotic scenes. In Mexico, experienced paper cutters can make large wall hangings and tablecloths out of papel picado. Papel picado is often taught in public schools, although on the small eight-by-eleven-inch paper.
non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chP.txt:53:Journalism about Los Hermanos Penitentes has been sensationalistic, with lengthy descriptions of their Semana Santa rituals, especially when Anglo Americans migrated to New Mexico during the late nineteenth century. Their custom of self-punishment, in the form of flagellation during the Holy Week ceremonies, aroused much interest and was reported widely in many East Coast publications. The most sensitive and nonjudgmental writing and research have been conducted by de Cordova, Henderson, Sprott, and Weigle. A worthy, contemporary (1970–1986), descriptive account of the ritual ceremonies associated with Holy Week in Cordova can be found in Charles Briggs (1988).
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch6.txt:52:The faith in the American nation, along with the inalienable right to happiness, constitute affirmations of the American civic religion. They belong side by side with the frequent invocations, on the currency of the affirmation of faith: “IN GOD WE TRUST.” These are the background assumptions by which we live. The same is true of the sense of nationhood. In 1892, the secular prayer to the flag and the nation—the Pledge of Allegiance—would spontaneously sweep the country.19 It stood for the idea that the United States was “one nation indivisible”—a residue of “the war between brothers” that occurred thirty years before. However important these ideas may be in American civic religion, however much they dominate the thinking of Americans in the civil society that exists side by side with government, they might not be suitable as legal doctrines for deciding court cases.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch6.txt:79:Yet, the values of nationhood and equality would not remain forever hidden, camouflaged in the deep structure of constitutional thought. They would begin to reassert themselves both in the political arena and in the courts. The debate in the Slaughterhouse case had failed to take seriously the issues either of nationhood or of equality. The dissent never got to the question of equality because they were satisfied that the Louisiana statute violated the “privileges and immunities” of United States citizenship. The majority never reached that point because, as far as they were concerned, the Fourteenth Amendment had the limited function of eliminating statutory discrimination against African Americans. The Court’s view that the purpose of “equal protection of the laws” was solely to protect blacks from apartheid-like legislation was so clearly narrow-minded that it could not hold for long. Fourteen years later, the Court would extend the principle of equal protection to Chinese launderers in San Francisco subject to discriminatory enforcement of zoning regulations.32 This was the first step toward a sensible jurisprudence of equality.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch6.txt:113:Instead of integrating our nationhood and the commitment to equality into constitutional discourse, the Civil Rights Cases completed the process of driving Lincoln’s vision into the deep structure of our constitutional thought. The Court generated a surface discourse to camouflage the Secret Constitution. It bequeathed to us a narrow conception of state action that we are still struggling to overcome. And, more to the point, by undermining federal authority to remove the incidents and marks of slavery, the Court facilitated segregation in American society. It would be a mere dozen or so years until the Supreme Court upheld the idea that public facilities, including schools, might be “separate but equal”—thus institutionalizing apartheid for generations.53 At the same time that the courts drove the postbellum legal order underground, concerted action by the children of slave owners organized to frustrate the purposes of the Fifteenth Amendment. Various measures, including poll taxes, literacy tests, and organized violence, were used to prevent African Americans from realizing their right to vote. The Democratic Party gained the loyalty of white Southern voters and remained in power for more than half a century, largely on the basis of segregationist principles.54
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:5:In recent years, the Secret Constitution has come to assert itself in the opinions, particularly the dissenting opinions, of the Supreme Court. If we are to understand the impact of our implicit postbellum commitment to the ideas of nationhood, democracy, and equality, we cannot limit ourselves to the jurisprudence of the nine justices who happen to sit on the Court in Washington. The Secret Constitution has, in fact, a much deeper grounding in American political and legal culture, and it has come to express itself in diverse arenas. It spontaneously percolates through civil society. It shapes the process of constitutional amendment; indeed, virtually every constitutional amendment enacted since the Civil War expresses, in one way or another, the values of the Secret Constitution. This is true as well of the two leading proposed constitutional amendments that have gained a large political following in the last decade: the proposal to protect the flag against “desecration” and the movement to protect victims of crime. The values of the Secret Constitution have also found their way into subconstitutional federal legislation based, as a technical matter, on the Interstate Commerce Clause, granting Congress authority to regulate commerce “among the states.”1 The earlier defeat in the Supreme Court of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 meant that Congress had to find other means of bringing to bear the same set of values in the pursuit of equal treatment in public facilities and in the workplace. In order to see the resurgence of the three great ideas of the Secret Constitution—nationhood, democracy, and equality—we have to look afield, away from the courts, to these diverse areas that give birth to legal trends and define the bedrock of the American Constitution.2
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:21:In the case of liquor, in particular, Prohibition had the effect of making consumption tantalizing and exciting. The speak-easy, the drink on the sly, the home brew—all these brought extra pleasure to those who imbibed. The effect of Prohibition was much the same as in the case of flag burning. The law’s forbidding the act makes it more thrilling. The effect is just the opposite of that intended.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:23:For many, the limitations on governmental power represent a trivial and self-evident proposition. But those who believe in the power of government, as I do, should pay heed. And conservatives, who are generally skeptical of the power of government, would do well to ponder the analogies between Prohibition and the drive for prayer in the schools or the criminalization of flag burning. Of course, there are some areas, such as the protection of the victims of crime, where only the government can act. Of that problem there will be more to say later.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:61:The same could be said of devotion to the nation. The state must engage in some elementary gestures of national pride. It must define and disseminate a flag, a national anthem, and celebrate holidays such as the Fourth of July, Veterans’ Day, and the birthdays of great national leaders. Nations that fail to do these things have trouble melding their people into a single culture of national identity. A good example is Israel, which has yet to find a holiday that Jews and Arabs can celebrate together. We live in a time of national disintegration—witness Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and the near-misses in Canada—and, therefore, the state is properly advised to cultivate a common identity and a sense of shared history and destiny.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:62:Since the Civil War, the United States has hardly lacked a strong sense of national patriotism. But the state has had to do little to further it. In the 1890s, the Pledge of Allegiance, our secular prayer to the flag, spontaneously spread across the country and became a standard part of the socialization process for all American children. There was little national hesitation about our wars of national aggrandizement against militarily weak opponents in Cuba and Panama. And the country joined enthusiastically in sending our doughboys overseas, in President Wilson’s words, “to make the world safe for democracy.” The generation that fought and won World War II is still with us, infusing in both blacks and whites a strong sense of a national mission well executed. The war in Vietnam was undoubtedly a setback for the spirit of patriotism. A whole generation—my friends and students—became skeptical about the use of military power. Yet, to my surprise and somewhat to my chagrin,14 a new cohort took up the sentiments of their grandparents and enthusiastically supported the questionable goals of the government in the Gulf War. As we were bombing Iraq, the country erupted again in a spontaneous display of unity and patriotic enthusiasm. Yellow ribbons appeared everywhere. It reminded one of the pledge that burst out a hundred years earlier, a paean to the flag in school houses around the country.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:63:Civil society is a powerful medium, and when the public takes up the cause either of religion or of patriotism, its strength overshadows the feeble efforts of government to manipulate its opinions. Yet, in both fields—religion and patriotism—we face a constant challenge from those who are unsatisfied with the successes of civil society. They want government to join the action. Nowhere is this more evident than in the politics of schooling. We worry constantly, perhaps with good reason, that the young in America are growing up with the wrong values. They supposedly suffer from all the mistakes of their elders who promote violence on television and have permitted the country to be flooded with guns, which, as everyone knows, enable teenagers who go on rampages to gain a few hours of prime time news coverage. One wonders, however, whether it is an effective response for government to require, as suggested in one Republican initiative, schools to post the Ten Commandments on schoolhouse walls. This drive toward governmental intervention in the field of value formation has been nowhere more evident—and questionable—than the recently revived push for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against protestors who want to burn it.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:64:The commitment to the flag has surely been one of the stable and recognized provisions of our sub rosa constitution. We do well to cultivate reverence toward the flag, which coupled with national rituals like the pledge, instills sentiments of national loyalty in our children. Although patriotic sentiments toward the flag antedate the Civil War, we begin to find, in the early twentieth century, a duty of reverence toward the Stars and Stripes formulated as a legal issue. In 1907, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction for flag desecration of a beer manufacturer who printed the flag on his cans. Appropriating the flag for commercial purposes was considered disrespectful.15
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:65:Our attitudes toward the flag were then so obeisant that we adopted religious language to describe acts of disrespect toward Old Glory. It would be difficult to say that piece of cloth on which the stars and stripes were printed was ever “consecrated” so that it could be “desecrated.” These terms imply the ritual use of an object exclusively for worshiping God. Despite the inappropriate use of religious language, the Supreme Court upheld this crime as a sensible expression of government’s instinct to protect the symbols of the nation.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:66:But then the commitment to national pride ran into a contrary trend in American thought that had been in the process of emergence for over a century. The impulse to protect the flag against desecration confronted the rising devotion to the cardinal American value of free speech. Since World War I and the dissenting opinion of Justices Holmes and Brandeis,16 the American recognition of the primacy of free speech has been on an upward trajectory. The Supreme Court, including its most conservative justices, has consistently favored the primacy of speech over the interests of victims injured or offended by the rough and ready rumble of the “marketplace of ideas.”17
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:67:The collision was inevitable. Two American ideas—protecting the flag and celebrating freedom of speech—would eventually come into focus as contradictory ways of being American. It was a close battle, but in two sharply divided votes of the 1990s, the Supreme Court decided that freedom of expression must prevail.18 But this was hardly a defeat for the politics of national sentiment. Those who loved the flag still had recourse to civil society.19 The proponents of patriotic rituals, such as honoring the flag, could learn from the history of religious sensibility in the United States. The government cannot coerce religious observance without, as John Locke argued in his first Letter Concerning Toleration (1689), corrupting the act of faith into an empty gesture of external compliance. The opposite effect occurs when the government seeks to punish those who burn the flag. The punitive sanction enhances the communicative sting of flag burning. The simple act of destroying a piece of cloth becomes a major event watched closely by the police and the media. The subsequent trial of the fla 
 burner gives him or her a platform for broadcasting the political views expressed in the illegal act. At one time, burning the flag was something like wearing a jacket in the courthouse blazoned with the words “Fuck the Draft.”20 But when flag burning becomes an acceptable and potentially routine event, it draws no more attention than the use of four-letter words at cocktail parties.
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:76:But civil society is not always to be trusted. Witness the drive toward a constitutional amendment to protect the flag against physical desecration. The amendment actually passed the House of Representatives in the summer of 1999, but it is not expected to command the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate. When speech induces a sense of victimization in minorities and women, many academics in the United States and even more lawmakers abroad reach for the arsenal of legal remedies to show their compassion for victims. Two basic strategies present themselves. One technique trades heavily on the values of the Secret Constitution and the other, characteristic of German thought, relies heavily on the Kantian concept of human dignity. The general principle of equal treatment, as we have elaborated it, lends itself to the argument for limiting freedom of speech. The claim is that obscenity degrades women and, thus, fails to treat them equally with the men who are interested in consuming the obscene material. Similarly, hate speech systematically degrades its targets and, therefore, treats them as unworthy of equal status in society. These are good arguments that draw on a long tradition of concern in the theory of equality for protecting the weak and defenseless.
non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch1.txt:40:Perhaps I can point again at the outset to the central question of an autonomous agent. Consider a bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient, its flagellar motor rotating. If we naively ask, “What is it doing?” we unhesitatingly answer something like, “It’s going to get dinner.” That is, without attributing consciousness or conscious purpose, we view the bacterium as acting on its own behalf in an environment. The bacterium is swimming upstream in order to obtain the glucose it needs. Presumably we have in mind something like the Darwinian criteria to unpack the phrase, “on its own behalf.” Bacteria that do obtain glucose or its equivalent may survive with higher probability than those incapable of the flagellar motor trick, hence, be selected by natural selection.
non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch1.txt:43:All free-living cells are, by this definition, autonomous agents. To take a simple example, our bacterium with its flagellar motor rotating and swimming upstream for dinner is, in point of plain fact, a self-reproducing molecular system that is carrying out one or more thermodynamic work cycles. So is the paramecium chasing the bacterium, hoping for its own dinner. So is the dinoflagellate hunting the paramecium sneaking up on the bacterium. So are the flower and flatworm. So are you and I.
non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch3.txt:77:Now we can return to my jumped-to definition: An autonomous agent is a reproducing system that carries out at least one thermodynamic work cycle. That bacterium, sculling up the glucose gradient, flagellum flailing in work cycles, is busy as hell doing “it,” reproducing and carrying out one or more work cycles. So too are all free-living cells and organisms. We do, in blunt fact, link spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes in richly webbed pathways of interaction that achieve reproduction and the persistent work cycles by which we act on the world. Beavers do build dams; yet beavers are “just” physical systems.
non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch4.txt:111:Notice that the closure in catalytic and work tasks cannot be defined “locally.” No single reaction, no single linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes typically suces to specify the closures we are describing. These closures are typically collective properties of the entire autonomous agent in its environment. In fact, cells achieve closure in some wider range of tasks by which they propagate their organization. Thus, cells carry out measurements and record them all the time. The bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient was my initial candidate example of an autonomous agent. The bacterium does so by molecular “sensors” that measure glucose, a molecular motor with a stator and a rotor that can rotate in either direction, and a flagellum that can rotate in two directions, causing “swimming” in one direction and “tumbling” in the other. The cell achieves swimming “upstream” by continuing to swim if the glucose concentration is rising and tumbling then swimming in a random direction if not.
non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt:46:Early in his career, after emigrating to the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles. One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim, Mead & White.

travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-WhereToGo.txt:88:Nearby, along Vas. Olgas, is the impressive Olympic Stadium, sitting in the lea of Ardittou Hill. The stadium was constructed for the ancient Panathanaic Games when each of the surrounding city-states sent delegations to compete. During Roman times beast-baiting also took place here. Dating from the third century b.c., the complex was refurbished for the games of a.d. 144 but was disused and left to decay after the fall of the empire. When the modern Olympic Games were convened in 1896, the stadium was refurbished as the flagship arena, and today it stands as a symbol of the global athletic movement. Witness the heroic statues that stand in the entranceway. Athens will once again host the games in 2004, but the central athletic complex will be at Kifissia — a northern suburb linked to the downtown area by bus and Metro.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:26:Over the centuries, trouble on the nearby American continent has often meant good news for the Bahamas. When Lincoln ordered a blockade of the southern states in 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War, the Bahamas quickly boomed. Nassau harbor was busy with ships unloading Confederate cotton and tobacco and taking aboard arms, medicine, and manufactured goods, mainly from Europe, to be run back through the northern blockade. As the war went on, speedy and camouflaged contraband vessels were built to slip past the ever-increasing Federal patrols. Profits from blockade running were incredible, and Nassau went wild. But the extravagant parties and carefree spending stopped abruptly with the North’s victory in 1865. Late the following year an immense hurricane sent a tidal wave over Hog Island (today Paradise Island), smashing Nassau’s flimsy buildings and ruining crops. Other islands were also devastated. As the Bahamas sank back into economic doldrums, citizens turned to agriculture, fishing, or salt raking. The spread of lighthouses and decent navigational charts had crippled the old standby, the wrecking trade.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:40:In 1955 the British government signed the Hawksbill Agreement, which gave Groves 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of land and a concession to import duty-free goods. In return Groves agreed to build a deep-water harbor and to encourage business development. First there was boom, then there was bust, but a container port opened in the 1990s is breathing new life into the flagging commercial sector. The opening of the first casino in 1964 sparked the tourist boom and, since then, Grand Bahama has been busy developing as a tourist “mecca.” Its modernity and the close links with the US create a totally different atmosphere and style compared to what you’ll find in New Providence, and many visitors enjoy the more “American” feel.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:73:An airport north of Treasure Cay serves the resort and the northern offshore cays. A regular ferry service links with the flight times. Twenty minutes offshore is Green Turtle Cay. Much more lush than many of the other islands in the Bahamas, this hilly, 3-mile- (5-km-) long cay is covered with pine woodland that camouflages many of its houses and resorts. A Loyalist settlement dating from 1783 — groups of colonists were evacuated from Savannah and Charleston along with black slaves who escaped their owners — Green Turtle in recent years has become a getaway for the rich and famous. The hotels here have all the luxuries you could ever need, yet you might feel as if you’re a million miles away from the worries of the world. The cay is small enough to explore on foot but most people choose to rent a golf cart or bicycle (your hotel can make the arrangements).
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bali-History.txt:32:On 30 September 1965, a group of army conspirators, who claimed they acted to prevent a possible coup against Sukarno, kidnapped and killed six army generals. In the following days, General Suharto, one of the most senior surviving commanders, isolated the conspirators and effectively seized power. The blame for the killings was pinned on the Communist Party, the PKI, which denied any involvement. A pogrom was then unleashed, first in Java and next in Bali, with widespread killings of suspected Communists. The Chinese minority, mainly shopkeepers, moneylenders, and other small businesspeople, were also a target. In common with the other immigrant groups, they had been compelled by law to display the flag of their country of origin, even if a century had passed since their ancestors had come to Indonesia. Throughout Indonesia, every Chinese business, marked by the flag of China, and associated in people’s minds with communism, was attacked. The numbers killed will never be known: in Bali alone the total casualties may have exceeded 60,000.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bali-WhereToGo.txt:22:The beach is the real reason to be here, and even though you won’t escape the hawkers, it’s a rest cure after the bustle of the town. Swim only between the flags, where Australian-style lifeguards keep watch: the undertow and currents can be hazardous. Surf shops abound.        
travel_guides/berlitz2/Barcelona-History.txt:9:Catalonia’s legendary founding father also gave the budding nation its flag of four horizontal red stripes on a gold field, the oldest still in use in Europe. Legend holds that the stripes were etched in Wilfred’s blood, drawn on his shield as an escutcheon by the fingers of the Frankish king after the count had courageously defended his overlord in a battle.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Barcelona-History.txt:22:In 1931, general elections brought the Republican party to power, and King Alfonso XIII escaped in exile. The following year, Catalonia won a charter establishing home rule, restoration of the regional parliament and flag, and recognition of Catalan as the official language of the region. For the next several years the pendulum of power in Spain swung back and forth between Left and Right. The army rebelled in 1936, initiating the brutal and bloody Spanish Civil War, in which both sides committed atrocities. Many of Barcelona’s churches were put to the torch by anti-clerical mobs. The city, firmly Republican, briefly became the capital in late 1937 and was a rallying point for the International Brigade. Barcelona was one of the last cities to fall to the rebel troops of General Francisco Franco at the war’s end in 1939.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt:29:The Ajuntament, or Casa de la Ciutat, across the plaza has held Barcelona’s city hall since 1372. It was here that the Consell de Cent, a council of 100 notable citizens, met to deal with civic affairs under the watchful eyes of the king. The original entrance can be seen around the left corner of the building, on the carrer de la Ciutat. Inside, the left staircase leads to the upper gallery of the old courtyard and to the Saló de Cent (Hall of the One Hundred). Its high ceiling resembles the barrel-vault of the Saló del Tinell, and was built at about the same time in the 14th century. The red-and-yellow bars of Catalonia’s flag decorate the walls. The hall where the city council now meets adjoins, and at the head of the black marble staircase is the Saló de les Cròniques (Hall of the Chronicles), noted for the modern murals in sepia tones by Josep Maria Sert.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Berlin-History.txt:54:The final push which led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall came when an ecological campaign in Leipzig against nuclear weapons and industrial pollution grew into nationwide pressure for democratic freedom. In 1989, with thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West via Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the country was swept up in the wave of eastern European revolutions unleashed by the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. His visit to East Berlin in October 1989 for the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic left it clear that Soviet troops would no longer shore up its regime. The Berlin Wall was opened on 9 November 1989, and at midnight on 3 October 1990, a huge black, red, and gold national flag was hoisted at the Reichstag. East and West Berlin were again one.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-history.txt:8:In 1606 James I granted a charter to the Virginia Company to establish the first English colony in America, named Jamestown in the king’s honor. Three years later a second contingent of settlers set sail from Plymouth under Admiral Sir George Somers. Less than halfway across the Atlantic, the fleet ran into a vicious storm. The flagship vessel, called Sea Venture, was separated from the rest of the convoy and eventually snagged on the reefs just east of Bermuda on 28 July 1609.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Boston-WhereToGo.txt:42:Huguenot merchant Peter Faneuil (pronounced fannel, fan’l or funnel), gave it to the city in 1742. The original, consisting of a town hall above and a market below was burned down in 1762, but was swiftly rebuilt. Here on the second floor Boston’s great orators raised their voices against British tyranny, against slavery, and female oppression. It’s still used for meetings and assemblies. The vast painting behind the stage shows Daniel Webster and John Calhoun arguing over the Union. On the third floor the Museum of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, the oldest militia in the nation founded in 1637, displays historic flags, paintings, and military memorabilia (open Monday–Friday, 9am–5pm). The building’s most legendary feature is the grasshopper weathervane. No one knows really why tinsmith Shem Drowne chose the grasshopper motif, although some say it symbolizes good fortune. In 1805 Charles Bulfinch enlarged the hall.
travel_guides/berlitz2/California-WhereToGo.txt:67:On Church Street you’ll find the site of Father Serra’s original adobe church. Rebuilt in 1795, it is now the Royal Presidio Chapel (or Cathedral of San Carlos de Borromeo). By the waterfront is the Customs House Plaza, with the Maritime Museum, as well as the Old Custom House (1827), where the American flag was raised by Commodore John Sloat in 1846 when he claimed Monterey for the United States.
travel_guides/berlitz2/California-WhereToGo.txt:80:Inside the castle, the hodgepodge of periods and styles runs riot. The dining room has a magnificent cedarwood coffered ceiling from a Bologna monastery, and is decorated with the flags from the Sienna palio pageant. At the table set for 22 guests, Hearst’s dilettantism is emphasized by the sight of splendid, solid silver Queen Anne candlesticks and wine cisterns, which are set beside tomato ketchup, pickles, and mustard, all in their original bottles and jars.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-History.txt:19:The French army burned its flags and sailed home, followed by most of the merchants and colonial leaders, leaving the habitants to fend for themselves. After 150 years of courageous struggle against the harsh Canadian wilderness, New France was abandoned, the old country displaying a cruel lack of enthusiasm for what Voltaire dismissed as quelques arpens de neige — “a few acres of snow.”
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:152:If — oh, happy dream — all the old ethnic rivalries could be set aside, most Canadians would acknowledge that Québec is not only the “original” Canada of the first European settlement, but also the province that most comprehensively encompasses within its borders the world’s image of this huge country. To begin with, it is itself huge: It could contain, according to your taste, three Frances or seven Britains. Most of it — two-thirds of the area — is forest. The north is coniferous, serving the province’s important pulp and paper industry, and the south is deciduous, with the maple of the national flag providing delicious syrup, and the ash, oak, and beech that blaze into crimson, amber, and gold in autumn.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:174:The rue St-Sulpice takes you over the Place d’Armes, close to the site of the first French battles with the Iroquois. Today it serves as a visual link between the historic old town of the pioneers and the new city of commerce and industry. In the middle is a statue of Maisonneuve, looking very like one of Alexandre Dumas’ musketeers. He’s brandishing the royal French fleur-de-lys flag that inspired the Québec provincial flag of today. The 19th-century Neo-Gothic Notre-Dame Basilica was designed by James O’Donell, an Irish Protestant New Yorker so inspired by his assignment that he converted to Catholicism. It once took 12 men to ring the great bell in the west tower, a task now accomplished with electricity. The garishly opulent interior was the work of a Québécois, Victor Bourgeau. Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Chapel, behind the main altar, unites modern and traditional religious art in a more intimate setting for marriages and memorial services. A little museum displays church sculpture and painting, notably some almost surreal works by Pierre-Adolphe-Arthur Guindon, a Sulpician monk. Next to the church is the Seminary of St-Sulpice, Montréal’s oldest surviving edifice, built in 1685 to lead the missionary work among the Iroquois. It also boasts North America’s oldest public clock (1710).
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:207:In the middle of the island, close to where the French army burned its flags in Montréal’s military capitulation to the British in 1760, the D.M. Stewart Museum is a restoration of the fort commissioned by the Duke of Wellington 60 years later. The military drills and parades staged here in the summer by uniformed students pay appropriate homage to both French and British (more precisely, the Scots Highlander) tradition. The fort’s Military and Maritime Museum displays ship models, maps, navigational instruments, and Canada’s weapons and uniforms from the 17th century to World War II. Beyond Jacques Cartier Bridge, La Ronde amusement park plays every imaginable ultramodern variation on the swings and roundabouts of a country fair. Put the kids on the Gyrotron whirligig or Aquapark waterslide and watch (or forget about them) from the beer garden. The closest Montréal can take you to the tropics is among its exotic fish in the Aquarium on the other side of Dolphin Lake (Lac des Dauphins) from the waterslide park.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:323:Starting out from Summerside, this 288-km (173-mile) western circuit around Prince County, named after the provincial flower, takes you through the Acadian community (close to 15,000) living on the south coast around Egmont Bay. Many of the villages fly the Acadians’ blue, white, and red flag modeled on that of France, but with a single star added to the blue band. Visit the Miscouche Acadian Museum, just west of Summerside, and an Acadian Pioneer Settlement at Mont-Carmel. The island’s 19th-century shipbuilding industry is featured in Green Park museum and historic house at Port Hill. Gourmets head straight for the renowned oysters of Malpeque Bay. Out in the bay, on Lennox Island, is a settlement of Micmac Indians.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:419:Coming from Vancouver, board the car ferry at Horseshoe Bay for Nanaimo and head north on Highway 19. Turn west at Parksville to cross the island on Highway 4. This takes you through some of the province’s finest forestland: the red cedar of canoes, totem poles and longhouses; stately Douglas fir, mainstay of white man’s bridges, boats, houses, and flagstaffs; and the good old Sitka spruce Christmas tree.
travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhatToDo.txt:22:Swimming: There are many safe family beaches at all the major resorts, where breakwaters have created lagoon-like conditions. Be careful at all times on all other beaches. Even seemingly calm waters can hide dangerous undertows. Never swim alone. Some of the popular beaches have lifeguards and many now use a flag system: red — don’t swim; yellow — swim with caution; green — safe to swim.
travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt:14:The capital of Tenerife and the administrative center for the westerly Canaries, Santa Cruz is not a city in which tourists spend a great deal of time. The main square is the Plaza de España, in the middle of which stands a four-sided cross, a memorial to the dead of the Spanish Civil War. The huge, drab, gray building adjacent to the Plaza is the Cabildo Insular (local government headquarters) which also houses the tourist office and the Museo Arqueológico, with important exhibits illustrating the life and death rituals of Guanche society (see page 13). The museum is open Tuesday–Sunday 10am–8pm and the entrance fee is a mere 400 pesetas (free on Sundays). Back on the seafront, discover the Iglesia Matriz de la Concepción (Church of the Immaculate Conception). Dating from the early 16th century, this is the town’s most important historical building and contains several interesting relics, including Nelson’s faded battle flag.
travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt:153:Betancuria, by far the most attractive and visited inland town on the island, is an oasis of greenery on this barren island. Although the riverbed here is almost perpetually dry, the town is fortunate to have a high water table. Because of its theoretical invulnerability at the heart of the island, it was made Fuerteventura’s first capital in the early 15th century. However, in 1539 somehow the ravaging Berber pirates overcame the mountains (which still provide a difficult drive today), and destroyed the original cathedral. The present 17th-century church, Iglesia de Santa María is a splendid building and hosts many interesting treasures. Look at the unusual wooden beams between the flagstones on the floor, the wooden altar and choir, and the decorated pulpit. Adjacent to the museum is a leather factory-cum-shoe-shop, set in an atmospheric old building. Wander round this lovely little town and admire the view from across the bridge, where there is an unpretentious restaurant/bar and a gift shop. Just south of Betancuria is the neat and pretty village of Pájara, but a stop at Antigua, on the other side of the mountains is in order. This is reached either by continuing on the loop past Tuineje, or backtracking from Betancuria and taking the FV-416 across the mountains. In either event, once in Antigua — the island’s capital from 1834–1835 — you can’t miss the traditional old windmill found just to the north of town, and this is your destination. Actually, the Centro de Artesania “Molino de Antigua” (Windmill Crafts Center) is much more than just that, and has something for almost everyone’s tastes. Interesting crafts and a visit inside the windmill certainly, but also ethnographic and archaeological exhibitions, modern art, an audiovisual room, rooftop view- points and an intriguing cactus garden, not to mention a nice restaurant.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-History.txt:28:Despite its considerable oil reserves and mineral wealth, debt, booming population growth, and grinding poverty have crippled the economy of modern Mexico. In an effort to bring more hard currency into the country, the government decided to promote tourism. A three-year study of various sites was conducted by a consortium of government and private interests, and the deserted island of Cancún won out: not only was it a beautiful spot, but its use would revive the flagging economy of the Yucatán and finally bring Quintana Roo into the fold. The territory was eventually granted statehood in 1974, the same year that Cancún opened to the public.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-WhereToGo.txt:12:This part of Cancún has the calmest sea for swimming and snorkeling, lying as it does in the shelter of Isla Mujeres just offshore. At km 3.5 you’ll find Playa Linda Marine Terminal, where a number of pleasure craft leave for trips to Isla Mujeres or sunset cruises. One, the Captain Hook, resembles a pirate ship; shipmates play games while sailing the high seas. At km 5 you will pass a huge Mexican flag, one of only seven this size in the whole country. You can see it from most points on the island; it is only taken down in high winds. Just beyond the flag on the left is Tortuga Pier, hosting boating trips and the ferry terminal, plus access to Playa Tortuga beach. Kilometer 7 sees a right turn to the 18-hole Pok-Ta-Pok golf course, which is located on a large land-mass that juts out into the lagoon.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-WhereToGo.txt:95:The heart of the city is Plaza Major (also known by a variety of names such as Plaza des Armas, Plaza Principal, Plaza de la Independencia, and Plaza de la Revolucion). Its tree-lined center has shaded seats where everyone comes to meet and talk; shoe-shine boys work throughout the day, while ice-cream sellers stand on street corners with their small barrows. Look out for the confidenciales, or love seats, where courting couples could sit next to each other without compromising the woman’s reputation. In the center of the square is a flagpole supporting a Mexican flag, which is raised and lowered at the start and end of each day (6am and 6pm) in an elaborate ceremony undertaken by the local police band. Numerous historic buildings, dating back to the very earliest days of Spanish rule, line the square and its surrounding grid of streets. Construction of many of these buildings used stones from the Mayan city of T’Ho, so, alas, nothing remains of this site.
travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhereToGo.txt:30:At the time of the emperors, the square was only about one-fourth its present size. In the old, less expansive square Mao Zedong first raised the flag of the new nation on 1 October 1949. On 1 October 1999, the People’s Republic celebrated its golden anniversary, each of the square’s concrete blocks freshly replaced by stately granite.
travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhereToGo.txt:321:Chinese pilgrims of all political persuasions come from many countries to honor the founder of the Chinese Republic at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen (Zhongshanling), in the Purple Hills east of Nanjing. The hillside complex roofed with blue tiles, completed in 1929, could scarcely be more grandiose. Following a long winding avenue planted with plane trees, you continue up the 392 granite steps of the ceremonial staircase to the actual memorial hall. There are statues of Dr. Sun standing, sitting (by a French sculptor, Paul Landowski), and recumbent above the vault itself. On the ceiling is a mosaic version of the Nationalist (Guomindang) flag, a white star on a blue background. Dr. Sun often roamed these hills during his Nanjing years. It was his own wish that he be buried here, although he could never have anticipated the imperial splendor that developed.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Costa-WhatToDo.txt:11:Many beaches now fly the blue EU flag, which means that water quality and general sanitation meets environmental standards established by the European Union.
travel_guides/berlitz2/CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt:11:Each phase of the fight is closely controlled by the presidente, from his flag-draped box. He drops two handkerchiefs, one to signal the swaggering parade that precedes the fight, and the other to release the first bull from the puerta de toriles, the matador’s “gate of fear,” for the opening act or first tercio. The bull is played with magenta capes — first by the matador’s team, or cuadrilla, then by the matador himself. All the time the torero is assessing the bull, noting his temperament, how he charges, and how he uses his horns.
travel_guides/berlitz2/CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt:32:Like resorts elsewhere in the Mediterranean, those on the Costa Blanca have no lifeguards. There are Red Cross offices on the most popular beaches, but other than that, you’re on your own. Flags are used at all beaches to advise swimmers of sea conditions: a green flag means the sea is safe for swimming, while a red flag warns of danger. Normal precautions apply here as elsewhere: beware especially of water-skiers and speed-boats, which sometimes stray from their flagged areas.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Crete-History.txt:16:This great civilization came to a sudden, catastrophic end around 1450 b.c. The exact cause remains unknown, but all the palaces were destroyed at the same time. The charred remains at Knossós and ash at Zákros suggest a great conflagration. A leading theory for many years was that natural disaster struck the island in the wake of the volcanic explosion on the island of Thíra (Santorini), due north of Crete, bringing a maelstrom of tidal waves, earthquakes, and fire storms. The most recent research has uncovered evidence supporting another hypothesis — that an attack by invaders or rebel forces may have brought about the end of this fine culture. Scholars will continue to debate the reason for many years to come.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Crete-WhereToGo.txt:127:The Akrotíri Peninsula sits north of Soúda. Here you’ll find Chaniá’s airport, several small villages, and three important monasteries. Seventeenth-century Agía Triáda is still a major pilgrimage site and its church is decorated with impressive modern icons. Moní Gouvernétou, a smaller community, lies further north. Its icon of St. John is the focus of many pleas for help. From here you can hike cross-country to the evocative remains of Katholikó, Crete’s first monastery, founded in the 11th century by St. John the Hermit. Set on the side of a rocky ravine and incorporating several caves, the monastery was sacked by pirates, after which the community moved to higher ground and founded Gouvernétou. As you head back toward Chaniá stop at the tomb of Elefthérios Venizélos (1834–1936), Crete’s greatest statesman, and that of his son. On this spot on the orders of Venizélos, the Greek flag was raised in defiance of talks taking place among the major European powers about the fate of Crete. There are wonderful views across the bay to Chaniá from here.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cuba-WhereToGo.txt:27:In 1791 the seat of government and the governor’s (or captain general’s) residence were transferred from the fort to the newly built, baroque Palacio de los Capitanes Generales (Palace of the Captain Generals) on the square’s western flank. A magnificent structure that was the presidential palace and then the municipal palace until Castro seized power, it now houses the Museo de la Ciudad de la Habana (the Museum of the City of Havana). Beyond the serene courtyard and its statue of Columbus lie a succession of splendid marbled and chandeliered rooms, some housing old cannonballs and coaches, others decked out in gilded furnishings. The most hallowed room commemorates Cuba’s 19th-century independence wars, with the very first Cuban flag and venerated personal objects from generals of the day.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cuba-WhereToGo.txt:95:Even the beach, Varadero’s best feature, can be problematic. Northern winds kick up with considerable frequency, and lifeguards put out the red flags to warn of the dangerous undertow. There is often a strong smell from the oil pumps on the resort’s outskirts. Prostitution and hassling are constant and blatant, and other pests (namely, mosquitoes) are a real annoyance. Moreover, the resort is spread out over 17 km (11 miles), with no real center, so you need transport to get around.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cuba-WhereToGo.txt:177:The fine Cementerio Santa Ifigenia, just north of the harbor (Av. Crombel and Reparto Juan Gómez), is the resting place of many Cuban heroes. Pride of place goes to the Cuban founding father José Martí, in a vast octagonal mausoleum designed so that the tomb catches the sun throughout the day. Look also for the tombs of Céspedes and Frank País; Frank’s (as santiagueros refer to him) is marked like many others with the Cuban flag and the
 flag of the 26 July movement.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-History.txt:47:Buddhism in Tibet and Nepal is influenced by elements of Tantrism, techniques to speed up enlightenment. These include learning physical and mental control through yoga exercises, and also prayer and meditation rituals such as repeating certain phrases, or mantras, and concentrating on geometric designs called mandalas. Prayer wheels (which hold a scroll covered with prayers) and flags multiply the power of prayer by adding to devotion the energy of movement. Tantrism is also the source of the male and female symbols of the thunderbolt (vajra, also called dorje) and the bell (ghanta), usually present in Buddhist ceremonies, and of the system of lamas or high priests, who are held to be reincarnations of holy men.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhatToDo.txt:88:You can photograph the head-chopping in the Kot Courtyard off the Durbar Square, where goats and bullocks are sacrificed for army units all morning long, as well as in the shops in the palace wall facing the temples in the square. Burly young soldiers are expected to dispatch the animals with a single stroke of the heavy khora sword, as the big drum thumps and martial music is played before the massed flags of Nepali regiments. The Kot Courtyard, incidentally, is where the first Rana engineered the massacre of a hundred nobles, clearing the path to power in 1846.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhereToGo.txt:41:The royal family lives in the modern Narayanhiti Palace across the street, behind flagpoles bearing the world’s only non-rectangular national flag. (Nepal’s is made of two superimposed triangular pennants with sun and moon emblems.) The palace stands at the head of the wide Durbar Marg avenue leading south. Here are airline and travel agency offices, banks, quality shops, restaurants, and leading hotels — the opposite pole of tourism from Thamel. Veer right at the end of Durbar Marg to reach the Rani Pokhari (Queen’s Pond).
travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhereToGo.txt:46:At the summit is one of the oldest stupas in the world, an immense white mound surmounted by a golden cube, on the four sides of which are the astonishing all-seeing eyes of Buddha. Above this rises a tower of 13 diminishing golden disks symbolizing the 13 steps to enlightenment, then a golden royal parasol topped by a bell-shaped crown. Strings of prayer flags stretch from the tower’s pinnacle, and around the base are hundreds of small prayer wheels. While pilgrims circumambulate the stupa, monkeys, dogs, and pigeons clamber about and forage for scraps of food offerings in small altars set in the foundation.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhereToGo.txt:52:Boudhanath, 6 km (4 miles) northeast of the city center, is the valley’s second important stupa and is similar in many ways to Swayambhunath. The temple, constructed around a.d. 500, is encircled by monasteries, shops, and lodges for pilgrims. It cannot be seen fully until you enter its precincts through a narrow passage from the street. Then it looms above you, 38 m (125 ft) high, streamers of prayer flags fluttering gaily against the sky. It is possible to reach terraces around the dome by climbing a staircase guarded by painted, man-bearing stone elephants. The all-seeing eyes here seem genuinely penetrating, almost glowering above the whitewashed dome. The question mark “nose” is actually the Nepali numeral one, meaning the only way to enlightenment is by following the rules of conduct laid down by the Buddha.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhereToGo.txt:72:At the center of the square is the Royal Palace, founded in the 15th century and better known as the Palace of 55 Windows. From atop a pillar, a statue of King Bhupatindra Malla, who embellished the square in the 18th century, looks down onto the glorious Sun Dhoka, the Golden Gate, which serves as entrance to the palace. The gateway, created at the height of Malla development in 1753, surpasses anything of its kind in the valley. The ten-armed goddess in the center of the torana is Taleju, pulling the hair of a demon beneath a pot-bellied Garuda, assorted writhing snakes, and cavorting attendants. The gate is topped with the double pennants from which the Nepal national flag is derived.
travel_guides/berlitz2/NewOrleans-History.txt:31:As usual, New Orleans was among the last to learn this, thanks to the secrecy of diplomatic negotiations and the slow communications of the age. In the event, within one month three different flags flew over the Place d’Armes (now Jackson Square). The Stars and Stripes replaced the French flag on 20 December 1803, only three weeks after the Spanish gave way to the French. Once again, the stunned citizens felt abandoned and betrayed. 
travel_guides/berlitz2/NewOrleans-History.txt:46:In April 1862, a Union naval force led by David G. Farragut capitalized on Confederate unpreparedness and penetrated the defenses of New Orleans. Despite localized opposition, within a week, the Union flag was raised over the city. It announced a military occupation destined to endure beyond the Civil War (or War between the States, as it is known in the south) into the Reconstruction period — for a total of 14 bitter years. The reconstruction of New Orleans began in 1879, when the jetties were built to speed the flow of the Mississippi near its mouth. This improved navigation and returned the port to a position of strength. New railway lines linked the city with the rest of the United States.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Paris-WhereToGo.txt:114:With its four glass towers in the shape of open books, the new national library, Bibliothèque François Mitterand, is the flagship building of the redeveloped Tolbiac district east of the Gare d’Austerlitz. The vast riverfront complex surrounding a sunken garden of some 250 exotic trees is popularly known as the TGB (Très Grand Bibliothèque: “Very Big Library”). More formally, it also bears the name of François Mitterrand, for whom it was the ultimate (but posthumous) achievement of his ambitious building program for Paris. Opened in late 1996, it houses over 12,000,000 books and has a state-of-the-art electronic retrieval system that’s open to the general public and research scholars.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Paris-WhereToGo.txt:128:The main courtyard allows access to the adjoining church of St-Louis-des-Invalides, decorated with flags taken by French armies in battle. The courtyard itself contains the 18 cannons, including eight taken from Vienna, which Napoléon ordered fired on great occasions — including the birth of his son in 1811. The cannon sounded again for the 1918 Armistice and the funeral of Marshal Foch in 1929.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Portugal-History.txt:25:The most significant expedition under Manuel’s flag was Vasco da Gama’s legendary sea voyage from Lisbon in the summer of 1497 — immortalized in The Lusiads (1572), the epic poem by Portugal’s national poet, Luís de Camões (1524–1580). Rounding what is now known as the Cape of Good Hope, da Gama found what Columbus had been searching for in 1492 (although in the wrong direction): the sea-route to the lucrative spices of the East. The Portuguese thus ended the Venetian monopoly on Eastern trade and began attracting merchants from all over Europe to Lisbon.
travel_guides/berlitz2/Portugal-WhatToDo.txt:37:Swimming. With great beaches all round the Portuguese coast, opportunities for swimming could not be better. The Algarve has warmer water and more sheltered beaches than the west coast. Lifeguards are not common. Most hotels have swimming pools. Because of pollution along the Estoril Coast, you should not swim any closer to Lisbon than at Estoril itself, which has been granted an EU blue flag (for safe conditions).
travel_guides/berlitz2/Portugal-WhatToDo.txt:51:The beaches of the Algarve, with long, sandy, gently shelving beaches for small children and small rocky coves ideal for older children to explore, are perfect for family holidays. Pay attention to the beach warning flags, however. Green means the sea is calm and a lifeguard is on duty; green plus a checkered flag means that no lifeguard is on duty; yellow urges caution; red means danger and warns bathers to stay ashore.
travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-History.txt:18:El Morro was not, however, invulnerable. A few years later, a British fleet commanded by George Clifford, the Earl of Cumberland, shrewdly outflanked the fortress. Far outnumbered by the 1,700-man invasion force, the defenders of El Morro surrendered after a two-week siege. But the English flag did not fly over San Juan for long. Four hundred of Cumberland’s troops died in an epidemic of yellow fever and dysentery, and the British had to withdraw less than three months after their victory. The Dutch were the next to try: in 1625, they succeeded in pinning the Spanish into the confines of El Morro; but after looting everything of value, they set fire to San Juan and departed. Because surrender was never considered, the Spanish — and today’s Puerto Ricans — regard this episode as a victory.
travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:122:Perhaps one of the most beautiful and unusual buildings in Charlotte Amalie is the St. Thomas Synagogue, on Crystal Gade. This is the oldest synagogue building in continual use under the American flag. The Jewish congregation has always been strong here, from the very earliest days of Danish settlement in 1655. When the all-consuming fire of 1831 broke out, 64 families were worshipping in the small synagogue. Only one scroll could be saved before the flames destroyed the building. The present structure was built on the same spot and opened in 1833. The synagogue has sand on the floor, symbolic of the Jewish flight from Egypt.

This can be useful if we don't need to see the lines but instead understand in which files a phrase occurs frequently.

Let's take a look at an example:

```
$ grep -rc "hello"

As we can see in this example, for every file that was searched, we know how many matches were found. If you back up to the first example in the section about the ```-n``` option, you will see two files had a match. If you look through the output from the command above, you will see those two files have 1 match each.

Here's another example:

```

Just as before, we have a list of the files searched and how many matches were found in each file. If you take a look at the second example from the section on the ```-n``` option, you will see that there is a LOT of output since there are many matches and every matching line is printed. With the command above, the output is much shorter and gives us a high-level overview of where the matches are.

## Option 3: -L

The next ```grep``` option we will explore will be the ```-L``` option, which prints the name of every input file, which does not have a match, which would be particularly helpful if we expect that every file searched will contain some phrase.

Let's take a look at an example:

```
$ grep -rL "home" non-fiction/OUP
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch14.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch6.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch7.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch8.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chZ.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch1.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch2.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch10.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch4.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch6.txt
non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch7.txt
```

As we can see in this example, we are returned a list of files which does not contain "home". If I was a writer, I may want to go back and edit my work if I desired that every file had some mention of the word.

Here's another example:

```
$ grep -rL "success" travel_guides/berlitz2
travel_guides/berlitz2/Algarve-Intro.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Algarve-WhereToGo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Amsterdam-Intro.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-Intro.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-Intro.txt

travel_guides/berlitz2/Bali-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Barcelona-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Beijing-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Beijing-WhereToGo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-history.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Budapest-History.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Budapest-WhereoGo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/California-History.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/California-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/California-WhereToGo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/CanaryIslands-WhereToGo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhereToGo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Costa-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/CostaBlanca-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Crete-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cuba-History.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Cuba-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Portugal-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Portugal-WhereToGo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhatToDo.txt
travel_guides/berlitz2/Vallarta-History.txt
```

Just as before, we have a list of all the files that do not contain "success", which would help me identify where there may exist failures that I can address and fix.

## Option 4: -m

The last ```grep``` option we will explore will be the ```-m``` option, which stops reading a file after the max count of matches is reached for that file. This can be helpful to get a guage for what the matches look like in each file while not overwhelming the terminal with output.

Let's take a look at an example:

```
$ grep -rm 1 "flag" 
.git/hooks/fsmonitor-watchman.sample:           # return the fast "everything is dirty" flag to git and do the
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch3.txt:In 1911, John Wanamaker opened his flagship store in downtown Philadelphia. The twelve-story building, with its forty-five acres of floor space, was the largest of its time devoted to retail merchandising. Its central “Grand Court” had marble arches that rose 150 feet and was capped by a dome. Major physical innovations were hidden behind this visual wonder: sixty-eight state-of-the-art elevators; the latest in fireproofing; a large power plant devoted entirely to the store; and sophisticated heating, ventilating, and sanitation systems.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch9.txt:The flow of operations through a typical men’s dress-shirt sewing factory is shown in Figure 9.1 (page 160). The subassemblies for the collars, backs, fronts, cuffs, and sleeves might be on one side of a center aisle down the factory floor and the major assembly steps on the other side. The factory manager needs to keep track of the flow of items through the plant to assure that the subassemblies, such as the sleeves, are ready to join the shirt. A given shirt must have a specified collar size and a given sleeve length. Clearly, the fabric, color, and style must also match. If the cut bundles are sent to the factory once a week, this manager might then put that week’s bundles into carts identified by a flag flying the color for that week. Note that the work in a shirt plant is generally grouped into production lots of 1,500 shirts if the progressive bundle system is used. Shirts are normally counted by the dozen, so a production lot comes to 125 dozen.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chP.txt:The craft and final product of cutting out intricate designs and patterns on sheets of tissue paper. In Mexico the artists who do this work have been doing it for several generations and can cut through fifty or more sheets at a time. A pattern is made and used as the top sheet while the outline design is cut out with different-sized chisels. Most often the small banner-sized sheets are made to decorate altars and nacimientos (nativity scenes), or for such celebrations as Cinco de Mayo (the Fifth of May) and El Diez y Seis de Septiembre (the Sixteenth of September). Mexican restaurants are often decorated with streams of colorful papel picado. Some of the cutout designs are scenes related to specific holidays, such as skeletons for Día de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead), dancers, floral patterns, the Mexican flag, and other patriotic scenes. In Mexico, experienced paper cutters can make large wall hangings and tablecloths out of papel picado. Papel picado is often taught in public schools, although on the small eight-by-eleven-inch paper.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch6.txt:The faith in the American nation, along with the inalienable right to happiness, constitute affirmations of the American civic religion. They belong side by side with the frequent invocations, on the currency of the affirmation of faith: “IN GOD WE TRUST.” These are the background assumptions by which we live. The same is true of the sense of nationhood. In 1892, the secular prayer to the flag and the nation—the Pledge of Allegiance—would spontaneously sweep the country.19 It stood for the idea that the United States was “one nation indivisible”—a residue of “the war between brothers” that occurred thirty years before. However important these ideas may be in American civic religion, however much they dominate the thinking of Americans in the civil society that exists side by side with government, they might not be suitable as legal doctrines for deciding court cases.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch9.txt:In recent years, the Secret Constitution has come to assert itself in the opinions, particularly the dissenting opinions, of the Supreme Court. If we are to understand the impact of our implicit postbellum commitment to the ideas of nationhood, democracy, and equality, we cannot limit ourselves to the jurisprudence of the nine justices who happen to sit on the Court in Washington. The Secret Constitution has, in fact, a much deeper grounding in American political and legal culture, and it has come to express itself in diverse arenas. It spontaneously percolates through civil society. It shapes the process of constitutional amendment; indeed, virtually every constitutional amendment enacted since the Civil War expresses, in one way or another, the values of the Secret Constitution. This is true as well of the two leading proposed constitutional amendments that have gained a large political following in the last decade: the proposal to protect the flag against “desecration” and the movement to protect victims of crime. The values of the Secret Constitution have also found their way into subconstitutional federal legislation based, as a technical matter, on the Interstate Commerce Clause, granting Congress authority to regulate commerce “among the states.”1 The earlier defeat in the Supreme Court of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 meant that Congress had to find other means of bringing to bear the same set of values in the pursuit of equal treatment in public facilities and in the workplace. In order to see the resurgence of the three great ideas of the Secret Constitution—nationhood, democracy, and equality—we have to look afield, away from the courts, to these diverse areas that give birth to legal trends and define the bedrock of the American Constitution.2
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch1.txt:Perhaps I can point again at the outset to the central question of an autonomous agent. Consider a bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient, its flagellar motor rotating. If we naively ask, “What is it doing?” we unhesitatingly answer something like, “It’s going to get dinner.” That is, without attributing consciousness or conscious purpose, we view the bacterium as acting on its own behalf in an environment. The bacterium is swimming upstream in order to obtain the glucose it needs. Presumably we have in mind something like the Darwinian criteria to unpack the phrase, “on its own behalf.” Bacteria that do obtain glucose or its equivalent may survive with higher probability than those incapable of the flagellar motor trick, hence, be selected by natural selection.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch3.txt:Now we can return to my jumped-to definition: An autonomous agent is a reproducing system that carries out at least one thermodynamic work cycle. That bacterium, sculling up the glucose gradient, flagellum flailing in work cycles, is busy as hell doing “it,” reproducing and carrying out one or more work cycles. So too are all free-living cells and organisms. We do, in blunt fact, link spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes in richly webbed pathways of interaction that achieve reproduction and the persistent work cycles by which we act on the world. Beavers do build dams; yet beavers are “just” physical systems.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch4.txt:Notice that the closure in catalytic and work tasks cannot be defined “locally.” No single reaction, no single linking of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes typically suces to specify the closures we are describing. These closures are typically collective properties of the entire autonomous agent in its environment. In fact, cells achieve closure in some wider range of tasks by which they propagate their organization. Thus, cells carry out measurements and record them all the time. The bacterium swimming upstream in a glucose gradient was my initial candidate example of an autonomous agent. The bacterium does so by molecular “sensors” that measure glucose, a molecular motor with a stator and a rotor that can rotate in either direction, and a flagellum that can rotate in two directions, causing “swimming” in one direction and “tumbling” in the other. The cell achieves swimming “upstream” by continuing to swim if the glucose concentration is rising and tumbling then swimming in a random direction if not.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt:Early in his career, after emigrating to the United States from South Africa, Greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses, which led to an unusual commission: the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse. He gave the commercial building in Manchester, Connecticut, a new façade dominated by a large arch, over-scaled voussoirs, and a pediment. Inside, the barrel-vaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a Tuscan order. Greenberg had graduated from Yale in 1965, and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by Postmodernism. However, unlike Venturi and Moore, Greenberg was not coyly introducing Classical elements into a Modernist building; he was returning to Classical roots. From this modest beginning, over the next two decades, came a variety of commissions: a suite of rooms for the Secretary of State in the United States Department of State building, several college and university buildings, and a Roman Catholic church. His commercial work included a newspaper office building in Athens, Georgia, a new entrance for Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and a flagship store for Tommy Hilfiger in Beverly Hills. Greenberg is also known for large country houses, both in the United States and in Europe. Like Lutyens and John Russell Pope, he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential work—using Georgian and American Colonial styles. One of his early houses was inspired by Mount Vernon, another by Palladio’s unfinished Villa Thiene. Several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of McKim, Mead & White.

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-WhereToGo.txt:Nearby, along Vas. Olgas, is the impressive Olympic Stadium, sitting in the lea of Ardittou Hill. The stadium was constructed for the ancient Panathanaic Games when each of the surrounding city-states sent delegations to compete. During Roman times beast-baiting also took place here. Dating from the third century b.c., the complex was refurbished for the games of a.d. 144 but was disused and left to decay after the fall of the empire. When the modern Olympic Games were convened in 1896, the stadium was refurbished as the flagship arena, and today it stands as a symbol of the global athletic movement. Witness the heroic statues that stand in the entranceway. Athens will once again host the games in 2004, but the central athletic complex will be at Kifissia — a northern suburb linked to the downtown area by bus and Metro.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-History.txt:Over the centuries, trouble on the nearby American continent has often meant good news for the Bahamas. When Lincoln ordered a blockade of the southern states in 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War, the Bahamas quickly boomed. Nassau harbor was busy with ships unloading Confederate cotton and tobacco and taking aboard arms, medicine, and manufactured goods, mainly from Europe, to be run back through the northern blockade. As the war went on, speedy and camouflaged contraband vessels were built to slip past the ever-increasing Federal patrols. Profits from blockade running were incredible, and Nassau went wild. But the extravagant parties and carefree spending stopped abruptly with the North’s victory in 1865. Late the following year an immense hurricane sent a tidal wave over Hog Island (today Paradise Island), smashing Nassau’s flimsy buildings and ruining crops. Other islands were also devastated. As the Bahamas sank back into economic doldrums, citizens turned to agriculture, fishing, or salt raking. The spread of lighthouses and decent navigational charts had crippled the old standby, the wrecking trade.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:In 1955 the British government signed the Hawksbill Agreement, which gave Groves 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of land and a concession to import duty-free goods. In return Groves agreed to build a deep-water harbor and to encourage business development. First there was boom, then there was bust, but a container port opened in the 1990s is breathing new life into the flagging commercial sector. The opening of the first casino in 1964 sparked the tourist boom and, since then, Grand Bahama has been busy developing as a tourist “mecca.” Its modernity and the close links with the US create a totally different atmosphere and style compared to what you’ll find in New Providence, and many visitors enjoy the more “American” feel.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bali-History.txt:On 30 September 1965, a group of army conspirators, who claimed they acted to prevent a possible coup against Sukarno, kidnapped and killed six army generals. In the following days, General Suharto, one of the most senior surviving commanders, isolated the conspirators and effectively seized power. The blame for the killings was pinned on the Communist Party, the PKI, which denied any involvement. A pogrom was then unleashed, first in Java and next in Bali, with widespread killings of suspected Communists. The Chinese minority, mainly shopkeepers, moneylenders, and other small businesspeople, were also a target. In common with the other immigrant groups, they had been compelled by law to display the flag of their country of origin, even if a century had passed since their ancestors had come to Indonesia. Throughout Indonesia, every Chinese business, marked by the flag of China, and associated in people’s minds with communism, was attacked. The numbers killed will never be known: in Bali alone the total casualties may have exceeded 60,000.

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Barcelona-WhereToGo.txt:The Ajuntament, or Casa de la Ciutat, across the plaza has held Barcelona’s city hall since 1372. It was here that the Consell de Cent, a council of 100 notable citizens, met to deal with civic affairs under the watchful eyes of the king. The original entrance can be seen around the left corner of the building, on the carrer de la Ciutat. Inside, the left staircase leads to the upper gallery of the old courtyard and to the Saló de Cent (Hall of the One Hundred). Its high ceiling resembles the barrel-vault of the Saló del Tinell, and was built at about the same time in the 14th century. The red-and-yellow bars of Catalonia’s flag decorate the walls. The hall where the city council now meets adjoins, and at the head of the black marble staircase is the Saló de les Cròniques (Hall of the Chronicles), noted for the modern murals in sepia tones by Josep Maria Sert.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Berlin-History.txt:The final push which led to the collapse of the Berlin Wall came when an ecological campaign in Leipzig against nuclear weapons and industrial pollution grew into nationwide pressure for democratic freedom. In 1989, with thousands of East Germans fleeing to the West via Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the country was swept up in the wave of eastern European revolutions unleashed by the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. His visit to East Berlin in October 1989 for the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic left it clear that Soviet troops would no longer shore up its regime. The Berlin Wall was opened on 9 November 1989, and at midnight on 3 October 1990, a huge black, red, and gold national flag was hoisted at the Reichstag. East and West Berlin were again one.

The original, consisting of a town hall above and a market below was burned down in 1762, but was swiftly rebuilt. Here on the second floor Boston’s great orators raised their voices against British tyranny, against slavery, and female oppression. It’s still used for meetings and assemblies. The vast painting behind the stage shows Daniel Webster and John Calhoun arguing over the Union. On the third floor the Museum of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts, the oldest militia in the nation founded in 1637, displays historic flags, paintings, and military memorabilia (open Monday–Friday, 9am–5pm). The building’s most legendary feature is the grasshopper weathervane. No one knows really why tinsmith Shem Drowne chose the grasshopper motif, although some say it symbolizes good fortune. In 1805 Charles Bulfinch enlarged the hall.

To begin with, it is itself huge: It could contain, according to your taste, three Frances or seven Britains. Most of it — two-thirds of the area — is forest. The north is coniferous, serving the province’s important pulp and paper industry, and the south is deciduous, with the maple of the national flag providing delicious syrup, and the ash, oak, and beech that blaze into crimson, amber, and gold in autumn.

The main square is the Plaza de España, in the middle of which stands a four-sided cross, a memorial to the dead of the Spanish Civil War. The huge, drab, gray building adjacent to the Plaza is the Cabildo Insular (local government headquarters) which also houses the tourist office and the Museo Arqueológico, with important exhibits illustrating the life and death rituals of Guanche society (see page 13). The museum is open Tuesday–Sunday 10am–8pm and the entrance fee is a mere 400 pesetas (free on Sundays). Back on the seafront, discover the Iglesia Matriz de la Concepción (Church of the Immaculate Conception). Dating from the early 16th century, this is the town’s most important historical building and contains several interesting relics, including Nelson’s faded battle flag.

In an effort to bring more hard currency into the country, the government decided to promote tourism. A three-year study of various sites was conducted by a consortium of government and private interests, and the deserted island of Cancún won out: not only was it a beautiful spot, but its use would revive the flagging economy of the Yucatán and finally bring Quintana Roo into the fold. The territory was eventually granted statehood in 1974, the same year that Cancún opened to the public.

One, the Captain Hook, resembles a pirate ship; shipmates play games while sailing the high seas. At km 5 you will pass a huge Mexican flag, one of only seven this size in the whole country. You can see it from most points on the island; it is only taken down in high winds. Just beyond the flag on the left is Tortuga Pier, hosting boating trips and the ferry terminal, plus access to Playa Tortuga beach.

The bull is played with magenta capes — first by the matador’s team, or cuadrilla, then by the matador himself. All the time the torero is assessing the bull, noting his temperament, how he charges, and how he uses his horns.

The exact cause remains unknown, but all the palaces were destroyed at the same time. The charred remains at Knossós and ash at Zákros suggest a great conflagration. A leading theory for many years was that natural disaster struck the island in the wake of the volcanic explosion on the island of Thíra (Santorini), due north of Crete, bringing a maelstrom of tidal waves, earthquakes, and fire storms. The most recent research has uncovered evidence supporting another hypothesis — that an attack by invaders or rebel forces may have brought about the end of this fine culture. Scholars will continue to debate the reason for many years to come.

Seventeenth-century Agía Triáda is still a major pilgrimage site and its church is decorated with impressive modern icons. Moní Gouvernétou, a smaller community, lies further north. Its icon of St. John is the focus of many pleas for help. From here you can hike cross-country to the evocative remains of Katholikó, Crete’s first monastery, founded in the 11th century by St. John the Hermit. Set on the side of a rocky ravine and incorporating several caves, the monastery was sacked by pirates, after which the community moved to higher ground and founded Gouvernétou. As you head back toward Chaniá stop at the tomb of Elefthérios Venizélos (1834–1936), Crete’s greatest statesman, and that of his son. On this spot on the orders of Venizélos, the Greek flag was raised in defiance of talks taking place among the major European powers about the fate of Crete. There are wonderful views across the bay to Chaniá from here.

A magnificent structure that was the presidential palace and then the municipal palace until Castro seized power, it now houses the Museo de la Ciudad de la Habana (the Museum of the City of Havana). Beyond the serene courtyard and its statue of Columbus lie a succession of splendid marbled and chandeliered rooms, some housing old cannonballs and coaches, others decked out in gilded furnishings. The most hallowed room commemorates Cuba’s 19th-century independence wars, with the very first Cuban flag and venerated personal objects from generals of the day.

These include learning physical and mental control through yoga exercises, and also prayer and meditation rituals such as repeating certain phrases, or mantras, and concentrating on geometric designs called mandalas. Prayer wheels (which hold a scroll covered with prayers) and flags multiply the power of prayer by adding to devotion the energy of movement. Tantrism is also the source of the male and female symbols of the thunderbolt (vajra, also called dorje) and the bell (ghanta), usually present in Buddhist ceremonies, and of the system of lamas or high priests, who are held to be reincarnations of holy men.

Rounding what is now known as the Cape of Good Hope, da Gama found what Columbus had been searching for in 1492 (although in the wrong direction): the sea-route to the lucrative spices of the East. The Portuguese thus ended the Venetian monopoly on Eastern trade and began attracting merchants from all over Europe to Lisbon.

A few years later, a British fleet commanded by George Clifford, the Earl of Cumberland, shrewdly outflanked the fortress. Far outnumbered by the 1,700-man invasion force, the defenders of El Morro surrendered after a two-week siege. But the English flag did not fly over San Juan for long. Four hundred of Cumberland’s troops died in an epidemic of yellow fever and dysentery, and the British had to withdraw less than three months after their victory. The Dutch were the next to try: in 1625, they succeeded in pinning the Spanish into the confines of El Morro; but after looting everything of value, they set fire to San Juan and departed. Because surrender was never considered, the Spanish — and today’s Puerto Ricans — regard this episode as a victory.

When the all-consuming fire of 1831 broke out, 64 families were worshipping in the small synagogue. Only one scroll could be saved before the flames destroyed the building. The present structure was built on the same spot and opened in 1833. The synagogue has sand on the floor, symbolic of the Jewish flight from Egypt.

Originally from South America, they had traveled up through the Caribbean islands, surviving by cultivating modest crops and from what they caught from sea and shore. Nothing in the experience of these gentle people could have prepared them for the arrival of the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa Maria at San Salvador on 12 October 1492. Columbus believed that he had reached the East Indies and mistakenly called these people Indians. We know them today as the Lucayans. Columbus claimed the island and others in the Bahamas for his royal Spanish patrons, but not finding the gold and other riches he was seeking, he stayed for only two weeks before sailing towards Cuba.

On Eleuthera the explorers dug a fresh-water well — at a spot now known as “Spanish Wells” — which was used to replenish the supplies of water on their ships before they began the long journey back to Europe with their cargoes of South American gold. As for the Lucayans, within 25 years all of them, perhaps some 30,000 people, were removed from the Bahamas to work — and die — in Spanish gold mines and on farms and pearl fisheries on Hispaniola (Haiti), Cuba, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.

Bahamians have always had to fend for themselves, and this resourcefulness has led them to become proficient at a number of practical handicrafts, many of which make beautiful souvenirs. Straw goods are the most ubiquitous. The Seminole Indians of Red Bay on Andros are said to produce the finest work on the Bahamas, though each island has its own individual patterns and differences in style. It is still possible to watch the women at work on the islands of Andros and at George Town on Exuma. Straw work can be bought from small workshops in people’s homes or from the better quality straw vendors in Nassau. Prices can be high, but even small bowls make beautiful and practical reminders of your trip. The handmade pieces are likely to become rare within a couple of generations, because so few young Bahamian women are now taking up the craft. Be aware that much of the straw work, particularly the mass-market goods like hats and bags, is not made in the Bahamas but in Taiwan and China. If you want to be sure of getting genuine Bahamian straw work, buy from places such as The Plait Lady, who has a shop on Bay Street in Nassau; you’ll have to pay a little more but you’ll be sure you’re getting an authentic handmade work of art.

They make beautiful, natural souvenirs, but some may come from protected species. Do not buy coral or turtle products as this is illegal and only encourages further damage to these delicate and rare forms of sea life.

Many of the shops on Bay Street, at the International Bazaar, and the Port Lucaya Market Place offer beachwear and T-shirts galore. Sarongs, printed dresses, and shirts in light fabrics are sold in almost every craft stall in the straw markets. Light-cotton Androsia clothing, made on Andros, is perfect for the Bahamian climate; you’ll find these items all over the Bahamas.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:It’s not the largest of the Bahamas islands and not the most stunningly beautiful, yet when most people think of the Bahamas they first think of New Providence or its major town, Nassau. The island is only 80 square miles in size yet 180,000 of the 280,000 Bahamians lives here. The town and its port and international airport are the hub for every activity in the Bahamas. Government, administration, taxes, and furniture shipments for new homes all start from here and radiate out to the other islands. New Providence also attracts over 3 million visitors every year, and Nassau is one of the main cruise ports of the Caribbean. The island is a magnet for fun seekers and serious shoppers, and it serves both very well.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Nassau town has a fine pedigree dating back through colonial times, and the compact town center still has the feel of life under the English. Out in the natural harbor, which offered shelter to many a pirate ship, is a major port that can accommodate 15 large cruise ships at one time. This capacity was created in 1965 when public money was invested to dredge the port, specifically to allow bigger ships to enter. The huge vessels, hundreds of feet high, dwarf the towns buildings, which regulations set at a maximum of three stories, and create one of the most effective juxtapositions of modernity and history found anywhere in the world. The cruise port at Prince George Wharf brings in by far the majority of visitors to the Bahamas.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:The first sight that will attract your attention is the Straw Market on Market Plaza, which backs onto Woodes Rodgers Walk. For many years this has been the showcase for Bahamian handicrafts. Straw goods, including baskets and mats, are favorite souvenirs; each island produces straw goods in its own style and patterns. Bestsellers are hats, dolls, bags, and baskets. There is some exquisite work to be found, but be aware that with a decline in basket-making throughout the Bahamas, an increasing number of articles are imported from the Far East; most of these are at the cheaper end of the scale. The ubiquitous modern souvenir, the T-shirt, is also available, with an almost limitless number of pictures, patterns, and slogans. The ladies who run the stalls are easy-going and seem to have limitless enthusiasm for the next sale. You’ll hear numerous calls of “Hey, honey, come look for something nice here.”    
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:Without detracting from the significance of Columbus’s landing on the Bahamas, Newfoundland can lay a just claim to being the true beginning of Europe’s adventure in North America. Anyone seeking to understand Canada’s role in shaping North America should spare a few days for this bracing province of hardy fisherfolk — first Canadian land to be “found” and last to join the Confederation (incorporating Labrador), in 1949. The land and seascapes are impressively rugged and the spirited people a sheer delight. Life in isolated fishing communities has given the Newfies a keen sense of local identity. Citizens of the capital of St. John’s are “townees,” those on the outskirts “bay-men,” and the towns beyond are known as “outports.” “Canadian” is still reserved for a mainlander.

Just as before, we will see a maximum of three lines per file where "Bahamas" was found. This can give me a sense for how the Bahamas relates to other countries without having to see EVERY instance where the Bahamas is referred to.
